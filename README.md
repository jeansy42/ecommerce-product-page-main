## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

With the development of this project, I experienced for the first time the features provided by Tailwind, which confirmed that it makes the styling work much more comfortable. It contributed to my education with a new development perspective, such as working with SVG files seen as components in React.

### Continued development

I intend to keep studying, strengthen my programming foundations even more, and achieve the highest possible versatility. I will continue to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, TypeScript, and the React ecosystem.
